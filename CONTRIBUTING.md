## Contributing Rust Audits

This respository is primarily an aggregation of audits done by people employed
by Google, certifying code to be used in Google software. For this reason, we
unfortunately cannot accept audits directly from non-Google sources.

If you're trying to add a Google project to the set of aggregated audits, thank
you! You should reach out to @djkoloski. Please note that participating
requires copying all audit criteria into your `audits.toml` verbatim;
deviations/customizations will break our automatic aggregation jobs.
